TimeSearcher 1.1 does not contain much in the way of new technology,
but it is significantly different under the hood. The Jazz code for
scenegraphs and displays has been replaced with Piccolo code, which
gives us better performance with a significantly lower overhead - the
size of the code has been reduced by almost 30%.


Enjoy!
